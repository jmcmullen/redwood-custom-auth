# Redwood Custom Auth
Instead of relying on third-party authentication providers, this project implements authentication over Redwood's built in API using Prisma and GraphQL.

 - Also contains Styletron & Base Web components.

### Setup

We use Yarn as our package manager. To get the dependencies installed, just do this in the root directory:

```terminal
yarn install
```

### Fire it up

```terminal
yarn redwood dev
```

Your browser should open automatically to `http://localhost:8910` to see the web app. Lambda functions run on `http://localhost:8911` and are also proxied to `http://localhost:8910/api/functions/*`.

## Development

### Database

We're using [Prisma2](https://github.com/prisma/prisma2), a modern DB toolkit to query, migrate and model your database.

Prisma2 is [not ready for production](https://isprisma2ready.com) at the moment.

To create a development database:

```terminal
yarn redwood db up
```

This will read the schema definition in `api/prisma/schema.prisma` and generate a sqlite database in `api/prisma/dev.db`

If you've made changes to the schema run `yarn redwood db save` to generate a migration, and `yarn redwood db up` to apply the migration/ generate a new ORM client.
